# Horiseon Splash Page

Worked on refactoring code for a mock splash page for the company Horiseon.  Took the time to look through the .css and .html files, to clean up the code and reorganize it to for specificity purposes and to follow more cohesive semantic guidelines.  Also made sure that each line of code had a purpose and also functioned the way it was supposed to, including making sure there were no broken links or pictures on the html/page itself.

Also made sure to properly document the project as well as making a concise list of changes to my repo that I uploaded to github, making sure that each change was listed with a proper commit.
